# flow

Implementation, with addon modules, of a relatively simple flow engine.

* flow-core - provides the base flow functionality with a simplistic yaml based factory
* flow-common - providers common flows, deciders and tasks
* flow-spring - adds support for using spring factory created beans into flows
* flow-webhook - a web hook, based on JAX-RS, to execute flows.

Coming soon (tm)

* flow-message - messaging based execution of flows
* flow-scheduler - scheduled flow execution
