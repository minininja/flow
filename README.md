# flow

Implementation, with addon modules, of a relatively simple flow engine.

* flow-core - provides the base flow functionality with a simplistic yaml based factory
  
Coming soon (tm)

* flow-spring - adds support for using spring factory created beans into flows
* flow-webhook - web hooks, based on JAX-RS, to execute flows.  
* flow-message - messaging based execution of flows
* flow-scheduler - scheduled flow execution
